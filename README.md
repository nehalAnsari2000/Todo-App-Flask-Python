# Todo App

A simple Todo application built using Flask. This app allows users to add, update, and delete tasks. It also stores the tasks in a SQLite database.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a title and description.
- View all tasks in a table format.
- Update existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Tasks are stored in a SQLite database (`todo.db`).

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **SQLite**: A C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured SQL database engine.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the front-end structure and styling.
- **Render**: For deploying the application.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on **Render** and can be accessed at [Todo App on Render](https://todo-app-nehalansari.onrender.com/).
